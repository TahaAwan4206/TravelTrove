## What Inspired Us

We've all experienced the frustration of having the ideal food, restaurant, clothes, movie, or vacation spot on our minds, but struggling to define it. With our app, even a simple or detailed description can trigger AI-generated suggestions. This app addresses the difficulties in finding hotels and restaurants while also integrating a budget component to make dream vacations accessible to everyone.


## What We Learned

- **API Integration**: We mastered using various APIs, parsing JSON outputs into usable formats.
- **Backend-Frontend Connection**: We gained skills in connecting a backend API to a React frontend design.
Tech used: Open AI Key (For the hotels, restaurants, and locations api output) and React for the front-end, Unsplash API for Images, Leaflet React API for maps, API Ninjas Geocoding API
## Challenges

- **Data Parsing**: Parsing API outputs into user-friendly strings was challenging. It took quite  a bit of research and testing in order to get something to work!
- **Multi-API Interaction**: We overcame the hurdle of using two APIs consecutively, displaying potential results and passing relevant data to another API for image retrieval. Multiple API calls had multiple errors at first but through collaboration, we were able to identify a solution.
- Figuring out the timing and synchronization of these API calls to ensure a smooth user experience was a significant challenge.
-Using a maps api in react was also a major challenge 

## Proud Moments
- Completing the project swiftly in such a short time frame
- Collaborating as a diverse team who never with each other before and staying organized working on different components at the same time
- Creating project deadlines and milestones and celebrating when we accomplished them

## Next Steps

- Enhance by creating a user-friendly frontend.
- Expand API functionality: Provide direct hotel links, incorporate travel dates, restaurant availability, and even flight options.
- Introduce a starting location, potentially offering flight suggestions if air travel is chosen.
- Implement user accounts to save favorite destinations and share plans.
-  Explore integration with map services to visualize suggested locations
-Implement Google Maps API for ease of use
